# Net Speed

> Netspeed plugin is a basic Javascript Module used to check upload and download speed. ðŸš‚ðŸš‹ðŸš‹ðŸš‹ðŸš‹

## Functionality

The library exposes two functions

* checkDownloadSpeed
* checkUploadSpeed

### checkDownloadSpeed

The checkDownloadSpeed accepts two arguments:

1. The `baseUrl` - This refers to the url where the file is to be dowloaded from. This field is required to be of type `String`
2. The `fileSizeInBytes` - This refers to the size of the file to be downloaded. The file size is required to be of type `Number` and should always be in `Bytes`.

> The return value is an object which contains the download speed representation in `bits/second(bps)`, `kolibits/second(kbs)` and `megabits/second (mbs)`.

### checkUploadSpeed

The checkUploadSpeed sends a randomly generated `20 kilobytes` data stream to a given server endpoint and uses that to calculate the speed. It accepts only one argument in the form of a JavaScipt object

1. The `options` argument - This refers to the needed arguments in making a http request in node. The signature is as follows
2. The `fileSizeInBytes` - This refers to the size of the file to be uploaded. The file size is required to be of type `Number` and should always be in `Bytes`.

```js
const options = {
  // The hostname where the request would be made
  hostname: 'https://your-domain-name',
  // The port of the host
  port: 80,
  // The endpoint available for uploading the data stream
  path: '/speed-checker-upload',
  // The http methos
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    // Format being used. Currently we just send a json file stream
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
};
```

> PS - The hostnames given here are for sample use.

## Usage

```javascript
const NetworkSpeed = require('rovel.js').netspeed;  // ES5
const testNetworkSpeed = new NetworkSpeed();

getNetworkDownloadSpeed();

async function getNetworkDownloadSpeed() {
  const baseUrl = 'http://eu.httpbin.org/stream-bytes/50000000';
  const fileSizeInBytes = 50000000;
  const speed = await testNetworkSpeed.checkDownloadSpeed(baseUrl, fileSizeInBytes);
  console.log(speed);
}

getNetworkUploadSpeed();

async function getNetworkUploadSpeed() {
  const options = {
    hostname: 'www.google.com',
    port: 80,
    path: '/catchers/544b09b4599c1d0200000289',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };
  const fileSizeInBytes = 2000000
  const speed = await testNetworkSpeed.checkUploadSpeed(options, fileSizeInBytes);
  console.log(speed);
}
```
